# INF.03 Exam Repetition
This website was created for the purpose of receiving a scholarship called Lubuscy Zawodowcy. This is a quick information summary of one of the polish IT technician exam. It was very useful for me, because I could learn for it while I was making the website and for my friends that was using my "blog" and exercising before the exam. Pretty simple app without extended interactivity, nothing special, but I think it's good to mention that, because it underscored my sense of responsibility and willingness to confront challenges head-on.
